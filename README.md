# A simple Federated learning program
    This is a simple Federated learning practice, there are some tips need to notice:
    1. you need to create a new folder named 'data' in the Federated_learning folder, then the program will download datasets into it.
    2. the 'normal_model_test' folder is a controlled trial for Federated learning training.
# 3.  Start to train global model in the methods of Federated learning
 ```python
python A_simple_Federated_learning_Application/Fedrated_Learning/main.py --conf A_simple_Federated_learning_Application/Fedrated_Learning/utils/conf.json
```
# 4. Start to train global model in the normal methods
```python
 python A_simple_Federated_learning_Application/Fedrated_Learning/normal_model_test/main.py --conf A_simple_Federated_learning_Application/Fedrated_Learning/utils/conf.json
```
